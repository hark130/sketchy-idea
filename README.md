Reusable, stand-alone, Linux code

## SKETCHY IDEA (SKID)

My opportunity to write some clean Linux code that is tested and releasable.

## DEPENDENCIES

* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - The compiler
* [Check](https://github.com/libcheck/check) - A unit test framework for C

## USAGE

### Do Everything Everywhere All At Once

`make`

### Is everything installed properly?

`make validate`
