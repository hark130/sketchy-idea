#!/bin/bash

# This script was made to help automate exporting SKID output into a single
# text file to use as "proof" for my mentor.  It performs the following:
#
# 1. Prints identifying information
# 2. Runs the build system (which also executes the Check-based unit tests)
# 3. Executes the unit tests with Valgrind
# 4. Counts the number of unit tests
# 5. Misc. (e.g., executing bespoke manual test code highlighting features/functionality)
#    This work included three related builds: standard, nostartfiles, and nostdlib.
#    For each build, the script will:
# 5.A. Execute the binary (to prove it works)
# 5.B. Show the binary size (using ls)
# 5.C. Show an ELF summary (using file)
# 5.D. List the symbols (using nm)
# 5.E. Show shared object dependencies (using ldd)
# 5.F. Display the symbol table (using readelf)
