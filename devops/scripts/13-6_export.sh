#!/bin/bash

# This script was made to help automate exporting 13-6's output into a single
# text file to use as "proof" for my mentor.  It performs the following:
#
# 1. Stores the date
# 2. Runs the build system (which also executes the Check-based unit tests)
# 3. Executes the unit tests with Valgrind
# 4. Counts the number of unit tests (by running them again)
# 5. Misc. (e.g., executing bespoke manual test code highlighting features/functionality)

#
# PURPOSE:
#   Run manual test code in a standardized way
# ARGUMENTS:
#   command: The command, with a variable number of argments, to echo and then execute
# RETURN:
#   The exit code from command execution
#
